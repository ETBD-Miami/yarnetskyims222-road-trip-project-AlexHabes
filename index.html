    <p><b>Orlando, for most people, conjures up the image of theme parks (mainly Walt Disney World), but there is much more. In fact, Disney World is not in Orlando, but is in nearby Lake Buena Vista. With the estimated 52 million tourists a year, Orlando and many other areas in the region have developed a lot to offer a traveler who wants to see something other than a theme park [4].</b></p>

    <h2>History of Tourism</h2>
    
    <p>Perhaps the most critical event for Orlando's economy occurred in 1965 when Walt Disney announced plans to build Walt Disney World. Although Disney had considered the regions of Miami and Tampa for his park, one of the major reasons behind his decision not to locate there was due to hurricanes â€“ Orlando's inland location, although not free from hurricane damage, exposed it to less threat than coastal regions. The vacation resort opened in October 1971, ushering in an explosive population and economic growth for the Orlando metropolitan area, which now encompasses Orange, Seminole, Osceola, and Lake Counties. As a result, tourism became the centerpiece of the area's economy. Orlando now has more theme parks and entertainment attractions than anywhere else in the world [5].</p>

    <p>Another major factor in Orlando's growth occurred in 1962, when the new Orlando Jetport, the precursor of the present-day Orlando International Airport, was built from a portion of the McCoy Air Force Base. By 1970, four major airlines (Delta Air Lines, National Airlines, Eastern Airlines, and Southern Airways) were providing scheduled flights. McCoy Air Force Base officially closed in 1975, and most of it is now part of the airport. The airport still retains the former Air Force Base airport code (MCO) [5].</p>
