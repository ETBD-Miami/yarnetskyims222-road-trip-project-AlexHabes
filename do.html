    <p><b>Orlando is known for its abundance of tourist activities. Between the theme parks, resorts, shopping centers, sports complexes, historical landmarks, and other miscellaneous attractions, the city will keep you plenty entertained. Here is a list of some of the top things to do in Orlando:</b></p>

    <h2><a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/">Walt Disney World</a></h2>

    <p>The centerpieces of Walt Disney World are the four theme parks: The Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Disney's Hollywood Studios, and Disney's Animal Kingdom. Walt Disney World also has two of the world's three most popular water parks, Typhoon Lagoon and Blizzard Beach, both heavily themed. Two shopping and entertainment districts, Downtown Disney and Disney's Boardwalk, provide extensive shopping, dining, and entertainment options. If none of that strikes your fancy, check out some of the lesser-known activities: golf, tennis, boating, race car driving, spas and health clubs, backstage tours, sporting events, character dining, and much more [2].</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.universalorlando.com/web/en/us">Universal Orlando Resort</a></h2>

    <p>Universal Orlando consists of two theme parks (Universal Studios Florida and Universal's Islands of Adventure), an on-site waterpark (Volcano Bay), an on-site entertainment district (Universal CityWalk), eight Loews Hotels (Loews Portofino Bay Hotel, Hard Rock Hotel, Loews Royal Pacific Resort, Cabana Bay Beach Resort, Loews Sapphire Falls Resort, Universal's Aventura Hotel, Endless Summer Dockside Inn and Suites and Surfside Inn and Suites), and it will soon add a new theme park (Epic Universe) with an accompanying hotel [3].</p>

    <p>In 2018, SeaWorld Orlando hosted an estimated 4.594 million guests, ranking it the 10th most visited amusement park in the United States [4].</p>
