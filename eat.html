    <h2><a href="https://olered.com/orlando/">Ole Red</a></h2>

    <p>"Ole Red has your pass to misbehavin’, safely! Whether Ole Red is at the top of your bucket list or you’re just lookin’ for a little fun in the heart of sunny Orlando, we hope to see you at Ole Red. Trade the long lines, the crowds and the cute ears for some cold drinks, All-American fare and live music. While you’re here, dig into a plate of our Nachos or tackle the over-the-top Turkey Shoot Burger while sippin’ a Blake Shelton-approved cocktail like the Mai Tai. Not to mention, Blake knows a thing or two about spotting country’s next rising star, and we’re putting them on our state-of-the-art stage nightly. From hot up-and-comers to surprise celebrity guests, you never know who will take the stage. Ole Red gets its name from Blake Shelton’s breakout hit, 'Ol’ Red,' and being here is a lot like hanging out with the guy himself: laid-back and genuine, up for anything, a bit irreverent (but always fun)—and set to great music. No matter how you do Ole Red, you can expect an edge-of-your seat good time! Ole Red is your live music, safe spot. View all of our safety precautions on our website, we’re savin’ you a seat!"

    <h2><a href="https://www.evergladesrestaurant.com/">Everglades Restaurant</a></h2>

    <p>"At Everglades Restaurant at Rosen Centre, Chef Fred Vlachos presents a menu that is one part familiar, one part entirely unexpected, to offer patrons a down-to-earth, yet upscale meal that's truly meant to be savored, not simply to be admired on a plate. The array of prime steak and fresh seafood, as well as vegetarian offerings, incorporate classic Florida flavors to create a mouthwatering selection of starters, entrees and desserts that are unique to the Sunshine State and to Everglades Restaurant. Such a succulent menu deserves an equally sophisticated wine list, and once again, Everglades delivers. If Everglades food didn't create an ambiance all its own, the dining room would carry the meal, with the playful yet soothing décor devoted to the flora and fauna of the South Florida wetlands" [9].</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.4rsmokehouse.com/UCF-east-orlando">4 Rivers Smokehouse</a></h2>

    <p>"4 Rivers Smokehouse East Orlando is the sixth 4 Rivers Smokehouse in the 4R family and is located just half a mile from the entrance to The University of Central Florida campus. UCF fans and Orlando locals can enjoy "South's Best BBQ". as they cheer on the home team Knights. Charge on!" [11].</p>
